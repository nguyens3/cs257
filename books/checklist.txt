Notes (aka things to consider and change)
- How should it be mandated when searching for a range of years that the user inputs start_year = none and end_year=[a num]
-- this presents problems when the user should not interact with the None parameter and with the way we have written our usage statement
- Another issue is looking up an author by their first and last name
-- currently have not fixed this problem and you can only currently look up authors by their last name
- How do we handle it when an author or book or publication year does not exist
- Change the method books?? bc of the sort by year specification
